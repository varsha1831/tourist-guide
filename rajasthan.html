       A visitor of Rajasthan looks forward to views of historical monuments, lakes (of Udaipur) and hills ( Araballi) and
       desert. This trip added a new chapter to our previous experiences.During this trip, we discovered the beauty of the
       Ranakpur valley , lush green after monsoon. As our car travelled through winding roads of this valley , cutting through
       the green hills dotted with small hamlets and rolling meadows, we soaked in the tranquility of nature.

        We visited quite a few places and monuments we have missed out so far. We visited Sajangarh @ Udaipur, offering
        wonderful view of the city and lakes below) , Eklingji's temple (30 km from Udaipur), Snaolima temple ( on the way to
        Chittorgarh), Ranakpur's temples and Bikaner's forts.There was one problem we faced throughout this tour - that of
        cloudy sky, often coming in the way of photography.Nevertheless , we clicked a lot of photographs of the places,events
        and monuments, some of which are quite interesting.

       Bikaner, private collection of paintings @ Bikaner ( some of you may have heard/read of 'RasikPriya' series....
       presuambly the better paintings are in the private displays in the confines of the palaces, still a clutch of intersting
       ones in display @ Lalgarh Museum), sleepy pregnant camels in the Camel Farm.
