       Just like every other travel enthusiast who keeps Kashmir on their bucket list I was no different. And, I am glad I made
       my Thrillophilia plan my entire Kashmir tour with much élan. The Shalimar Bagh captivated my senses and the
       spell-binding sunset views at the Pari Mahal, over the Dal Lake, transported me to a different world.Thanks to
       Thrillophilia for booking my stays in hygienic guest houses that fed me delicious dinners, and sumptuous breakfasts. I
       will always cherish having lunch in the most wonderful environs, and my short drive to the Betaab valley that made me
       make the most of bright and beautiful mornings. Totally recommend Thrillophilia for a soothing trip and adventurous
       tour, all rolled into one!

       Whenever I think of Kashmir, the placid valleys, the snow and the stunning greenery blur past. We went to the iconic
       Gulmarg and Sonmarg and also took an unforgettable shikara ride in Dal Lake. I am still cherishing the memories of the
       trip I took in January this year with the images of ever-classic Aru and Doodhpathri Valleys still crossing my mind,
       every now and then. Go pack your bags and set off with Thrillophilia to make the most of humble Kashmiri hospitality and
       stay in plush guesthouses.

      My family and I envisaged a tour of Kashmir and thankfully that trip was made a reality by Thrillophilia with such
      finesse, that I don’t think I can ever be associated with any other tour company. Right from arrival in Srinagar to
      getting transferred to an incredible houseboat in Dal lake, our trip was every bit fascinating. We relished a delicious
      breakfast in the Panjal Range’s lap and headed off to Gulmarg for a soul-stirring experience. The pre-booked hotel at
      Pahalgam was a beautiful one and made our night stay a comfortable one. We will cherish the gondola cable ride at
      Gulmarg, the short day excursions to Anantnag Sulpher Springs, Avantiswami, and Avantishwar Temples. Thanks a ton to
      Thrillophilia, for making the Kashmir tour, a nice blend of adventure and travel by incorporating a fair share of
      outdoor activities with oodles of sightseeing. If you fancy visiting heaven on earth but are pressed for time, allow
      Thrillophilia to make a trip worth your while!
