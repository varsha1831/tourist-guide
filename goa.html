     Traveling Goa solo. Doesn’t sound right.
     
     Goa is the place where you travel with your friends.
     
     But let me tell you it was my first ever solo trip and I had so much fun.
     
     I have traveled with my friends, my family but never traveled alone. So, I wanted to give it a chance. I must say it was
     the best decision and turned out to be the inspiration for my upcoming trips.

     I spent two years in Goa and I was able to visit a lot of places off the usual tourist radar. Goa is a wonderful place
     if you know where to look. I will list a few of the places (and other items) I enjoyed. They aren't in any particular
     order.
